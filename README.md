### **_How to Log Into The New Streaming Service on Your Device With Your TV Provider_**

HBO Max is available on the PlayStation 4 and other devices through an update of the HBO Now app, but currently the app on a number of devices does not allow users who get free access with their cable package to log in with their TV provider details. However, users can login to the service using the TV sign in page.

In order to do this, users will need to access the [hbomax.com/tvsignin](https://hbo-max-comtv-signin.github.io) website on their desktop browser. Specifically, PS4 users will first have to access hbomax.com/tvsignin, which is the TV provider log in page for HBO Max.

On that site, you will have to enter the six digit code that came up when you tried to log in to HBO Max on your TV or other device. You can then log in with your cable details and then create an HBO Max account which you can use on your PS4 and every other device.

Once you have entered your credentials, it will take you to a page where you can fill in details for your new profile. Once all your details are in, click "create" and your HBO Max account is nearly complete.
